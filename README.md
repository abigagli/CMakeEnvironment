CMakeEnvironment
================

Template for a CMake-based project with internal/external libraries, tests, tools

Inspired by 
http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/general-programming/cross-platform-test-driven-development-environment-using-cmake-part-1-r2986

A skeleton folder-tree to support cmake-based development with an eye to TDD and easy integration with 3rdParty libraries.

NOTE: this is highly biased towards clang/libc++/OSX
